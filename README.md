# webpack-black-triangle

A minimal, development-focussed template to get you up and running with Webpack, Babel & LESS.

Read how it works at [jamesknelson.com](http://jamesknelson.com/write-es2015-with-instant-feedback-using-webpack-dev-server-and-babel/).

**Things it does**:

- Makes ES6 "just work"
- Compiles and includes your LESS files
- Serves your files
- Automatically recompiles/reloads your page when JavaScript/LESS files change
- Decide where your files go (to a degree)

**Things it doesn't do**:

- Handle your deployment build
- Include any runtime dependencies (other than babel's polyfill)

## Install with three lines

Just `git clone` & `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/jamesknelson/webpack-black-triangle.git
cd webpack-black-triangle
npm install
```

## Then use it with one more

Run the dev server:

```
npm start
```

Then open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
